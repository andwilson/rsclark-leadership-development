## A resource for non-profits to filter and assess leadership development programs

This repository serves to manage source code for a simple prototype to demonstrate the usefulness of having an aggregated list of leadership development programs for non-profits.  Foundations will often stipulate that non-profits invest in leadership development as part of receiving grant money.  The goal is to create a simple user interface to discover and assess these programs in one place.
